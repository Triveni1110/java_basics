package com.java.learning;

/**
 * There are thousands of in build classes in java present in JRE,for eg servlet,db,io,http...etc,
 * 
 * we group the classes and interface that are relatable and put under the pacakges.
 * 
 * Why Packages??
 * 
 * Normally,we  can put the classes wherever we can put
 * 
 * songs-> eng song and hindi song --> sad song and motivational songs..etc hierarchy ie. classification is required.
 * 
 * if you want to create your own package,
 * 
 * name should be unique may be mirror of your domain name ie....for google  it is...com.google
 * for teusko it is com.telusko
 * for ids it is com.ch.ids
 * 
 * further the ids can have source nd com.java.learning etc.....
 * 
 * nd source can have controller ,service,repo packages.
